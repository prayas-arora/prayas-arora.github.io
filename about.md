I am a first year Computer Science Masters student at University of Massachusetts Amherst. 

I have 2 years of engineering and applied machine learning experience at Microsoft Bing! where I built infrastructure to process high volume web-scale data. My major contribution was in Subintent Mining where I helped pushed 50+ Sub-intent models to production that impacted over *1* *million* Bing! queries.

I left Microsoft to co-found a small startup based out of Chandigarh, India called *'Think* *Binary* *Academy'*. At the academy, I conceptualized and instructed a specialized algorithms course for final year undergraduate students across North India. While I couldn't achieve all that I had hoped for, I did improve my leadership and management skills in the process.

On the lighter side, I enjoy early morning runs, and a movie with a big bucket of popcorns. TV shows I can't get enough of - Friends and Survivor.


### More!

Did I mention that I am actively looking for research internships for Summer 2018!?

If your company has some awesome ongoing projects in the field of Information Retrieval / Machine Learning, send me an email.

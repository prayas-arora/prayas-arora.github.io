<div class="intro" style="text-align: justify; float:left; width:70%; font-size: 14px;">
    I am a Software Development Engineer at Mentor Graphics, A Siemens Business.
    <p>I have 1 year of engineering and applied compiler design experience at QuestaSim! I built infrastructure to process high volume web-scale data. My major contribution was in Subintent Mining where I helped pushed 50+ Sub-intent models to production that impacted over <b>20</b> <b>million</b> Bing! queries.</p>
    <p>I left Microsoft to co-found a small startup based out of Chandigarh, India called <b>‘Think</b> <b>Binary</b> <b>Academy’</b>. At the academy, I conceptualized and instructed a specialized algorithms course for final year undergraduate students across North India. The entrepreneurial life was thrilling and involved a lot of learning.</p>

    <p>On the lighter note, I enjoy playing football and being on the bleeding edge of technology. I feel strongly that quality healthcare should be made accessible to all people everywhere. I would like to pursue philanthropy with my work. I volunteer and participate in communities working towards healthcare whenever I can. </p>
    <br/>
    <p>I am currently actively looking for <em>full time software development - Backend</em> positions. I am excited about building optimized infrastructure to handle the large scale of a consumer facing product.

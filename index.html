<div class="intro" style="text-align: justify; float:left; width:70%; font-size: 14px;">
    I am a Software Development Engineer at Mentor Graphics, A Siemens Business.
    <p>I have one year of engineering and applied compiler design experience at QuestaSim!
        I have worked for 6 months on the power aware team where I built low power APIs for QuestaSim Visualizer to detect and report activity
        count for design elements. I redesigned TCL APIs, fixed wave APIs for Visualizer and Information Model Database (IMDb). I wrote 
        scripts for implementing QuestaSim’s new messaging structs across the entire codebase and fixed some customer issues. 
       I also developed a methodology to implement web-based power aware report generation for RTL design.</p>
    <p> I've been working in the System Verilog team for the last 6 months. I've built infrastructure for dumping design information into 
        a TCL file for Graph Based Elaboration Flow of QuestaSim. I've fixed bugs across resolve, code-gen and elaboration phases of 
        QuestaSim for customers like ARM, Cisco, TeraDyne, Silicon Labs, Keysight Technologies and Broadcom.</p>
    <p> I have significant experience in Machine and Deep Learning. I've wokred on various projects but the one that stands out for me is:
        <b>‘Detection</b> <b>of </b> <b>Atrial Fibrillation of heart from a Single Lead ECG recording’</b>. I developed a Deep Learning
        model for detection of Atrial Fibrillation from a Single Lead ECG recording. The model classifies a single lead ECG recording 
        into Normal Rhythm(N), Atrial Fibrillation(AF), Other Rhythm(O), Too Noisy to be classified(~). I'm working to publish this work 
        as a research paper. I'm thrilled to have experienced the power of Machine Learning and excited to discover its untapped potential.</p>
    <p>On a lighter note, I enjoy playing football and being on the bleeding edge of technology. I feel strongly that quality healthcare 
        should be made accessible to all people everywhere. I would like to pursue philanthropy alongside my work. I volunteer and participate
        in communities working towards healthcare whenever I can. </p>
    <br/>
    <p>I am currently actively looking for <em>full time software development - Backend</em> positions. I am excited about building optimized
        infrastructure to handle the large scale of a consumer facing product. If your's is such a company and is also working in machine 
        learning, send me an email at <a href="mailto:arora.prayas@gmail.com">arora.prayas@gmail.com</a>. Also check out my

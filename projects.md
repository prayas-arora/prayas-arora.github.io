## Code Learn - Laravel, Vagrant, PHP, JS, RESTful API
The main aim of the website is to teach programming languages to the wide audience - interactively. It gave user a sandboxed environment to run their code and see the output interactively. Other functionality included taking quizzes and exams. Since the client's design was quite complex, a lot of effort was spent in optimizing the pages for faster image loading and relying on CSS for most of the effects.

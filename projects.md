##Subintent Mining - Machine Learning, Text Mining, C#, .NET, Perl
- Worked with a Senior Applied Scientist to implement the infrastructure for discovering the latent intent (Subintent) based on the research paper "Active Objects: Actions for Entity-Centric Search".
- Mentored two team members and together shipped 53 models to production over 2 years.
- Introduced temporal features into the existing EM algorithm, which improved the overall precision from 91% to 93% with no loss in recall. Presented poster at Microsoft ML conference 2014 for the same.
- Performed topic modeling over Wikipedia articles to semi-automate Subintent model selection process for popular entities, saving over 20 hours of manual work for each new Subintent model trained.

##URL-Action Clustering - Data Mining, C#, .NET, JQuery 
- As an initiative, I explored URL clustering based on user intended action. This went on to become part of our work charter and was used in production by Cortana to mine authoritative websites for user tasks.

##Sub-intent metrics and evaluation platform - Crowd sourcing, .NET
- Responsible for the measurement strategy for Subintent models
- Supervised creation of crowd sourcing app and infrastructure to measure models on identified matrices.

##Sub- Data Visualization Layer - Data Mining and Visualization, JQuery, CSS
- Mined data (Queries, User click data etc.) and used compelling visualization elements to generate useful insights e.g. overlapping across classifiers, potential false negatives, unidentified entities. 

##Drugs (Medicine) Classifier - Machine Learning
- Individually pushed a micro-classifier model to production with a precision of 92% and a recall of 91%.

##Snapandbuy  (2011) - PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL
- Developed from scratch a C2C e-commerce ‘reverse online shopping’ portal.
